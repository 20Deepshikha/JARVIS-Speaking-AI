 *********************** 



Dear Professor [Name],

I am writing to apologize for missing your class this past week. I understand that the information discussed in this session is important to my overall performance, and I regret that I could not attend. 

I have been experiencing stress related to my exams and as a result, it has caused my attendance to suffer. I understand that this is no excuse for my behavior, however, I would like to request special consideration in this matter. 

I hope that this email finds you well and remains respectfully yours, 

[Student Name]
