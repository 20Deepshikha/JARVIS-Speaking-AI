Subject: Request for Salary Increment

Dear [Boss's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing to request a salary increment, as I feel that I have been contributing consistently to the organisation since I joined in [month and year]. I have been fulfilling all my job duties and responsibilities and going beyond the scope of my job to help the company grow.

In the last [period of time], I have achieved [mention the achievements], which have brought profit to the organisation and increased its efficiency and customer satisfaction.

I strongly believe that I deserve a raise in my salary for the work I have completed. I appreciate your consideration and I would be grateful if you could give me a chance to meet with you and discuss this further.

Thank you for your time,

[Your Name]
